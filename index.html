        <h1>Life in My Perspective</h1>
        <p>
            Life is beautiful <br>
            even if we feel that it's not <br>
            we just have to see it from another angle <br>
            do it again <br>
            and again <br>
            and again. <br><br>
            If you still can't see its beauty <br>
            maybe you only see it <br>
            by your eyes <br>
            not by your heart. <br>
            God knows, God knows, God knows best. <br><br>
