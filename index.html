    <h1>Life in My Perspective</h1>
    <p>
        Life is beautiful <br>
        even if we feel that it's not <br>
        we just have to see it from another angle <br>
        do it again <br>
        and again <br>
        and again. <br><br>
        If you still can't see its beauty <br>
        maybe you only see it <br>
        by your eyes <br>
        not by your heart. <br><br>
        God knows, God knows, God knows best. <br><br>
